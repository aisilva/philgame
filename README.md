# philgame

This code is deprecated.

When it worked, this code played the Wikipedia Philosophy Game: take an article, and click the first link (with some constraints e.g. link must not be in parentheses) until reaching the Philosophy article or looping.

Typically Philosophy was reached in 25-30 clicks.
