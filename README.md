# philgame

This code is deprecated.

When it worked, this code played the Wikipedia Philosophy Game: take an article, and click the first link (with some constraints e.g. link must not be in parentheses) until reaching the Philosophy article or looping.

Typically Philosophy was reached in 25-30 clicks.

I believe the reason that this code does not function the way it used to is a change on Wikipedia's side, but I'm not certain.

If I were to redo this code I would use Python 3 and perhaps Beautiful Soup.
